# ProducDev

ProducDev is an extension built to track various metrics of your productivity within VSCode.

## Features

After logging into VSCode with GitHub, ProducDev will keep track of the projects and files that you work in and record the following:

- Minutes spent working in each project file
- Keystrokes made per file, to determine where you're doing the most coding
- The time you spend idle in each file, starting after five minutes of no inputs

Any other metrics that are included will be added here.

Users are able to view their metrics at [this webpage.](https://producdev-1277b.web.app/)
